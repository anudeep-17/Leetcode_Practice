# Leetcode_DS-ALGO_2023
Leetcode solutions with notes on optimization and logical solution for every problem. 

I use <b>Java</b> as primary language to solve the problems.

A daily update will be given on solved problems, please feel free to checkout soltuions and comeup with a better solution if possible . 

# Concepts:
1. Two Pointer: if a problem involves subarray or substrings it is mostly invovling two pointer concept. It reduces time complexity of a solution from N^2 to N.
